# Web-Browser-JS-Snippet-Video-Elements-Isolator

## Goal

The **Web-Browser-JS-Snippet-Video-Elements-Isolator** is designed to isolate video elements from a web page and remove basic no-download protections, allowing the downloading process with a simple button.

### Note

This process cannot enable downloading streaming live or hashed videos such as YouTube or equivalents.

### What the snippet does:

1. **Isolate Video Elements**: It removes all other page elements, leaving only the web page title and video elements.
2. **Add Buttons**: It adds a download and an expand button for each video element found on the web page.
3. **Remove Basic Protections**: It allows cursor video hover, right-click on the video element, and downloading the video from the right-click menu, the download button, or the controls submenu.

Feel free to ask if you need further assistance or have any questions!
  

## What Is a Snippet? 

A **snippet** is a script embedded into your web browser that can be executed on demand to interact with the current page. In the case of our JavaScript snippet, it's written in ES5 (ECMAScript 5) and allows you to manipulate the content of the New York Times article dynamically. 

  

**Warning**: Be cautious when using snippets from untrusted sources, as they could potentially include backdoors or malicious code. 

  

## Installation 

To use the snippet: 

  

1. **Access the Web Browser DevTools**: Open your web browser (such as Chrome or Firefox), navigate to the page with the New York Times article, and open the developer console (usually F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I). 

2. **Navigate to the "Sources" Tab**: In the developer console, switch to the "Sources" tab. 

3. **Create a New Snippet**: Within the "Sources" tab, find the "Snippets" sub-tab. Create a new snippet by clicking the "+" icon. 

4. **Rename Your Snippet**: Give your snippet a descriptive name for easy identification. 

5. **Allow Snippet Paste Code (First Use)**: If prompted, allow snippet "Paste Code". This ensures you can paste code and save your custom snippet. 

6. **Write or Paste Code**: In the snippet editor view, write your JavaScript code or paste an existing snippet. 

7. **Save the Snippet**: Press Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on macOS) to save your snippet. 

8. **Execute the Snippet**: Right-click on your snippet and select "Run" to execute it. The snippet will clean up the New York Times article on the current page. 

  

Feel free to customize the snippet further based on your preferences!
